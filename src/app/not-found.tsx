/**
 * Used by NextJS when a user tries to access a route that doesn't exist.
 *
 * The component's height is set using a calculated value to ensure it fits
 * within the viewport without causing overflow and the need for scrolling.
 * Initially, `min-h-screen` was employed with the intention of having the
 * component occupy the full height of the screen. However, this approach
 * didn't account for the navbar's presence, introduced by wrapping the
 * component in `DefaultLayout`, which occupies additional space at the top of
 * the viewport.
 *
 * To address this, the height is explicitly calculated as `100vh - 155px`.
 * This calculation subtracts the navbar's height from the full viewport height,
 * allowing the content of the `NotFound` page to be fully visible without
 * extending beyond the viewport's bounds and triggering a scrollbar. The
 * adjustment ensures the user can view the entire page content comfortably,
 * without unnecessary scrolling.
